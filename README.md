# QuantumWalks

We are an organization focused on implementing and developing various quantum walks model and its applications. Currently we are developing *Julia* modules.

The package implements open quantum walks based on GKSL master euqation. Detailed description of the package can be found on [arXiv:1801.01294](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01294)

The core package, which combines quantum walk models with its functionalities. First release is planned for June 2018. Currently under construction.

The package is designed for finding exceptional configuration, a combination of marked vertices, for which finding is particularly inefficent using coined and Szegedy quantum walk. Exemplary appliation of exceptional configrations are DoS attacks, see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10041). Currently under construction.
